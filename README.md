The increasing number of genomes to integrate the MicroScope platform, automating the syntactic pipeline becomes necessary to free human time and speed up their integration. One of the bottlenecks entranglement certainly remains the building of gene models currently requires human intervention to decide the number of models to build or to make a primo annotation (not annotated genome ) to undertake a re-annotation ( prediction and reconciliation with already a genome annotation data in the public domain ) . The objective of this project is to  eliminate human intervention at this important stage of the syntactic annotation pipeline.
